      I am a professor at Cornell University. My research focuses on algorithms
      and networks, the roles they play in large-scale social and information
      systems, and their broader societal implications. My work has been
      supported by an NSF Career Award, an ONR Young Investigator Award, a
      MacArthur Foundation Fellowship, a Packard Foundation Fellowship, a Simons
      Investigator Award, a Sloan Foundation Fellowship, a Vannevar Bush Faculty
      Fellowship, and grants from Facebook, Google, Yahoo, the MacArthur
      Foundation, the ARO, and the NSF. I am a member of the National Academy of
      Sciences, the National Academy of Engineering, and the American Academy of
      Arts and Sciences.
